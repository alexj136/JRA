MONDAY 17TH JUNE
- Began an interpreted implementation of the language in python
- Met with Martin, agreed roughly what I will be doing:
	- Completing an interpreted implementation of the language in python, with
	  a test suite
	- Doing the same again in C
	- Completing a compiled implementation of the language in C
	- Integrating the two C implementations in to a runtime environment that
	  performs some sort of cost-benefit analysis on code to work out if it
	  should be interpreted or JIT compiled

TUESDAY 18TH JUNE
- Read up on lexical analysis
- Book-keeping of code produced yesterday, including extensive comments

WEDNESDAY 19TH JUNE
- Debugging & refactoring of AST interpreter

THURSDAY 20TH JUNE
- A few more touches to AST interpreter
- Began implementation of lexer: sketched DFA and began implementing DFA as a 2D
  array

FRIDAY 21ST JUNE
- Continued lexer implementation

MONDAY 24TH JUNE
- Finished lexer implementation
- Read up on parsing

TUESDAY 25TH JUNE
- Implemented a simple example parser for the language 'begin prog; prog; end'
  from the lecture slides
- Restuctured project folder/hg repo
- Began parser implementation
- Realised I forgot to incorporate 'else' into the lexical spec, so I will have
  to change the transition table in the lexer

WEDNESDAY 26TH JUNE
- Incorporated 'else' keyword into FSM table in lexer
- Investigated using graphviz/dot to produce an FSM diagram for documentation
- Continued parser implementation

THURSDAY 27TH JUNE
- Continued parser implementation

FRIDAY 28TH JUNE
- Finished initial parser implementation
- Bug fixing in parser
- Unit tested lexer, began unit testing parser

MONDAY 1ST JULY
- Continued debugging and unit-testing parser
- Implemented printing and equality-checking of AST objects

TUESDAY 2ND JULY
- Continued debugging and unit-testing parser
- Finished graphviz FSM diagram

WEDNESDAY 3RD JULY
- Wrote up a breif lexical specification for minty
- Unit-tested interpreter
- 'Put to bed' the python implementation of minty. Could have...
	- Put more comments in AST.py
	- Made a more feature-rich front-end
- Worked through some C tutorial exercises to refresh my knowledge of C

THURSDAY 4TH JULY
- Did more reading/tutorials on C
- Began implementing the lexer in C

FRIDAY 5TH JULY
- Did more reading/tutorials on C
- Continued C implementation of lexer

MONDAY 8TH JULY
- Continued C implementation of lexer
