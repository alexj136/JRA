MONDAY 17TH JUNE
- Began an interpreted implementation of the language in python
- Met with Martin, agreed roughly what I will be doing:
	- Completing an interpreted implementation of the language in python, with
	  a test suite
	- Doing the same again in C
	- Completing a compiled implementation of the language in C
	- Integrating the two C implementations in to a runtime environment that
	  performs some sort of cost-benefit analysis on code to work out if it
	  should be interpreted or JIT compiled

TUESDAY 18TH JUNE
- Read up on lexical analysis
- Book-keeping of code produced yesterday, including extensive comments

WEDNESDAY 19TH JUNE
- Debugging & refactoring of AST interpreter

THURSDAY 20TH JUNE
- A few more touches to AST interpreter
- Began implementation of lexer: sketched DFA and began implementing DFA as a 2D
  array

FRIDAY 21ST JUNE
- Continued lexer implementation

MONDAY 24TH JUNE
- Finished lexer implementation
- Read up on parsing

TUESDAY 25TH JUNE
- Implemented a simple example parser for the language 'begin prog; prog; end'
  from the lecture slides
- Restuctured project folder/hg repo
