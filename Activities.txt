MONDAY 17TH JUNE
- Began an interpreted implementation of the language in python
- Met with Martin, agreed roughly what I will be doing:
	- Completing an interpreted implementation of the language in python, with
	  a test suite
	- Doing the same again in C
	- Completing a compiled implementation of the language in C
	- Integrating the two C implementations in to a runtime environment that
	  performs some sort of cost-benefit analysis on code to work out if it
	  should be interpreted or JIT compiled
